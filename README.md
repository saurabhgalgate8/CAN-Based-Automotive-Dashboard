🚗 Project Overview :

This project implements a CAN-based automotive dashboard system using three PIC microcontrollers (ECUs). Each ECU performs a specific function and communicates over a CAN bus to simulate real-time vehicle data transfer.

The system demonstrates how modern vehicles use distributed ECUs for efficient and reliable communication.

🧩 System Architecture :
The project consists of three ECUs:

🔹 ECU1 – Speed & Gear Node
Reads vehicle speed using ADC (potentiometer)
Reads gear position using keypad
Sends data directly to ECU3
🔹 ECU2 – RPM & Indicator Node
Reads engine RPM using ADC (potentiometer)
Reads indicator status using digital keypad
LEFT, RIGHT, OFF, HAZARD
Sends data directly to ECU3
🔹 ECU3 – Dashboard Node
Receives data from ECU1 and ECU2
Displays:
Speed
Gear
RPM
Indicator status
Acts as the final dashboard display unit


🔄 Working Principle :
ECU1 reads speed (ADC) and gear (keypad) → sends via CAN
ECU2 reads RPM (ADC) and indicator status (keypad) → sends via CAN
ECU3 receives both messages
Data is decoded and displayed on CLCD
🔌 Hardware Components

⚠️ Limitations :
Uses simulated inputs (potentiometers)
Basic text display (CLCD)
Limited number of parameters

🚀 Future Enhancements :

Use graphical display (GLCD/TFT)
Implement fault detection system
Integrate IoT/cloud monitoring

🎯 Conclusion :
This project successfully demonstrates a multi-ECU automotive system using CAN protocol. It shows how different nodes can independently generate data and communicate efficiently to a central dashboard, similar to real-world automotive systems.
